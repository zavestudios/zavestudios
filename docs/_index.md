# Application & Data Platform Engineering

Production-grade platform demonstrating infrastructure portability, multi-tenant architecture, and GitOps automation.

## What is ZaveStudios?

ZaveStudios is an Application and Data Engineering Platform running multiple tenant applications with isolated resources, shared services, and tenant-specific data isolation. The platform demonstrates production patterns for multi-tenancy, GitOps, cost-efficient infrastructure design and will soon feature meaningful AI integration.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Multi-tenant namespace and database isolation
- GitOps automation (Flux + ArgoCD)
- PostgreSQL multi-tenant secure and performant architecture experiments
- Zero-cost sandbox with AWS deployment capability
- Production-grade observability and security

## Getting Started

Follow this learning path to understand the platform:

1. **[Architecture](architecture/)** - Design decisions and patterns
2. **[Infrastructure](infrastructure/)** - Kubernetes clusters, networking, and databases
3. **[Platform Services](platform-services/)** - GitOps, CI/CD, and observability
4. **[Current Tenant Applications](applications/)** - Tenant applications and use cases
5. **[Experiments](experiments/)** - Proofs of concept and research

## Platform Status

**Current Phase:** Formation

The platform is in Formation Phase, focusing on surface stabilization.

See [platform-docs](https://github.com/zavestudios/platform-docs) for formation goals and exit criteria.
